# WhiteBoard
Shared whiteboards are one form of collaboration of the Internet, we developed a distributed whiteboard for individuals to access and communicate visually from different hosts according to the socket scheme. First, the report introduces the developments of remote applications. Then in the second part, it illustrates 

## Synopsis
###### Motivation
The purpose of this project is to implement a shared Whiteboard application which allows numbers of clients to share the paint from different location. Some basic operations are provided, such as draw line, curve, oval and text, all these function is based on the MS paint. Each operation of every client is updated through the server in real time. Besides the server establisher is the administrator, he can behave kick out, reject and allowance function.For the existing related applications, there are two programs, which are the Microsoft Paint and the Coccinella. This single white board of this project is based on the Microsoft Paint, which is a standard whiteboard program, but it is not distributed. It mainly has the core features of a whiteboard, 

###### Orignal
This is a project I made in Melbourne Unviersity. appreciate with my teammate: *Xun HU* who did (Drawing type, DataList, Broadcast) &Xuechong HAN who did (Colorpanel, Textpanel, StrokePanel,
SocketClient).I did the The mainframe, MeanuBar, LoginFrame, SocketServer,client part. 
######  features
-  Drawing of basic shapes, such as: straight line, curve, rectangles, polygon, and freehand drawing.
-  Using an empty and filled mode for shapes.

###### FAQ
-	How to implement the text input anywhere in the canvas?

At first, we plan to implement this as what is done in the drawing board of windows that create a small new Jpanel and type the words. But it is difficult to implement in Java. So as last we using the drawstring method in Java.awt package and use a JOptionPane to type the words.
-	How to notify all the users when the information is updated?

It is difficult and long latency to inform every client the latest update especially when there is large scale of clients using TCP protocol. So here we adopt UPD protocol to broadcast information that the server received synchronal. 
-	How to implement the function of administrator?

The ideal way is to create a separate UI interface which is different from clientsâ€™, including the kick and reject function. But we across some difficulties when we design the canvas and the data exchange, so we design the function of administrator separately with a client list instead of combining it with the whiteboard.

###### run
1. After the server start, it is required a port to build the server
2. Server is starting with a list of client and two buttons, one for kick out the selected client, one for refresh.
3. Start the client and it need some feature to build up the connection with the server.
4. The sever will show the one who want to join in.
5. The main GUI of the client: we can draw here with the different tools and the set for the tools. 
6. The server will join the information of the joined client.
7. We can share what we draw now.
8. When the server is broken, the client will show the information box and quit
9. When the client is kicked out, it will give a message and quit.
